# Features In This Project

### Navagation
* Instead of the navagation bar, I utilized a drop down menu. 

### About Me, Projects, Contact
* Utilized Bootstrap Cards for each section.
* Incorporated [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/) for a unique layout.
* Updated CSS to include hover feature for cards with text.

### API Integration
* As a former Art History student, I wanted to represent my interests so I included a section with a random selection from the MET Museum's database. I created a function that picks a random number and that object is fetched. I have a placeholder image if the expected image does not work.
